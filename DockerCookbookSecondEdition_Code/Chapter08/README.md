# Chapter 8

In this chapter there isn't really any code, it is mostly shell commands. They are all listed by section, with any comments that should make things a little more clear, when needed.

This chapter covers a few different operating systems and Linux flavors, I note which OS and flavor is needed next to each section to make it easier to know what you need in order to run correctly.
