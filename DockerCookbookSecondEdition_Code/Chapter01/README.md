# Chapter 1

In this chapter there isn't really any code, it is mostly shell commands. They are all listed by section, with any comments that should make things a little more clear, when needed.

This chapter covers a few different operating systems and Linux flavors, I note which OS and flavor is needed next to each section to make it easier to know what you need in order to run correctly.

There are a few commands that need to be run inside of a Docker container, there is a Dockerfile and a shell script that we use for that docker container in this directory. There is also some steps on how to build the container and run it so that you can easily reproduce the commands and output expected.

When finished, don't forget to stop and remove the container from your system. `docker rm -f ch1_1`

Let me know if there is anything I can do better, or if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ken Cochrane
